      <p> I am a detail-oriented problem-solver with 15 years in the education field, 
        earning my PhD in mathematics, coding for an online instructional tool, and 
        teaching mathematics and statistics at both the collegiate and high school levels, 
        where I have been recognized for my work (Granted the Joseph B. Whitehead Educator 
        of Distinction Award - 2018, peer recognized teaching award - 2018, and outstanding 
        TA - 2009). As chair of Priory's mathematics department, I have also lead/initiated 
        several projects including restructuring the mathematics curriculum, establishing 
        an inter-high school mathematics department gathering and idea exchange, and 
        co-leading Priory's 2018 reaccreditation. All this in addition to sharing my passion 
        for the technical language of mathematics and statistics, critical thinking, and 
        problem-solving with my students. <a href="http://www.lipsum.com/">www.lipsum.com</a></p>
